# Q Video game proton pack MK1
3d printable version of the of the proton pack from Ghostbusters : the video game

![Image of the proton pack](https://github.com/mr-kiou/q-pack/blob/master/protonpack_screenshoot.jpg)

Our goal is to make the best easy to use 3D printable "movie" version of the final upgraded proton pack from ghostbusters the video game.
Like the regular proton pack, everything is included (shell, legris , banjos, clippards, brackets, ...) and compatible with the MK2.1!

## Why "movie version of the final upgraded proton pack"? : 
Video game model is lacking detail, some are blocky or exagonal instead of round. 
Our goal, here, is to make an idealised rendition of what could have been the video game pack in the "real world" or in the "movie verse" but like the Qpack MK2.1, optimised for 3D printing.
